# David-Learns-MERN-Stack

## Description
The following application was built to learn how to build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Stack application, without Express and Node by using MongoDB Realm, by following a tutorial by Beau Carnes published on FreeCodeCamp.Org, which can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org! The following application is a restaurant search and review application, and some of it's features include:
- Searching for restaurants based on name, cuisine or zipcode
- Add / Update / Delete reviews for specific restaurants
- Look up all the available cuisines
- Check the location of a selected restaurant
