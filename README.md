# David-Learns-MERN-Stack

## Description
The following application was built to learn how to build a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Stack application by following a tutorial by Beau Carnes published on FreeCodeCamp.Org, which can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org! The following application is a restaurant search and review application, and some of it's features include:
- Searching for restaurants based on name, cuisine or zipcode
- Add / Update / Delete reviews for specific restaurants
- Look up all the available cuisines
- Check the location of a selected restaurant

## Developing the application
The application was developed using Insomnia for the API development to allow for quicker and easier testing of the REST requests directly!

## Styling
No custom CSS templates were used for this project, with all the styling done using bootstrap!
 
## Starting the application
